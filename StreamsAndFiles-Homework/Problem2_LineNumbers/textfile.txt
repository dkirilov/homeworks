Most modern text editors have at least basic support for regular expressions. In the
search or search-and-replace panel, you’ll typically find a checkbox to turn on regular
expression mode. Some editors, such as EditPad Pro, also use regular expressions for
various features that process text, such as syntax highlighting or class and function lists.
The documentation with each editor explains all these features.
